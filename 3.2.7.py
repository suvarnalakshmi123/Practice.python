Scenario
Do you know what Mississippi is? Well, it's the name of one of the states and rivers in the United States. The Mississippi River is about 2,340 miles long, which makes it the second longest river in the United States (the longest being the Missouri River). It's so long that a single drop of water needs 90 days to travel its entire length!
The word Mississippi is also used for a slightly different purpose: to count mississippily.
If you're not familiar with the phrase, we're here to explain to you what it means: it's used to count seconds.
The idea behind it is that adding the word Mississippi to a number when counting seconds aloud makes them sound closer to clock-time, and therefore "one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi" will take approximately an actual three seconds of time! It's often used by children playing hide-and-seek to make sure the seeker does an honest count.
Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippily" to five. Having counted to five, the program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"
Use the skeleton we've provided in the editor.

  import time

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i, "Mississippi")
    time.sleep(1)

print("Ready or not, here I come!")
